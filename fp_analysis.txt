QUESTION: can marijuana mental illness
========================================
CONTEXT:
 - The short-term effects of marijuana include problems with memory and learning, distorted perception, difficulty in thinking and problem-solving, and loss of coordination. Among youth, heavy cannabis use is associated with cognitive problems and increased risk of mental illness.
 - As a result of these studies, people have incorrectly inferred that marijuana use causes mental illness. However, this assumption stems from a basic misunderstanding of research results; namely, the fact that correlation does not imply causation. You may have heard this before.
 - This plant material can also be concentrated in a resin called hashish or a sticky black liquid called hash oil. THC is believed to be the main chemical ingredient that produces the psychoactive effect. Marijuana is often smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes (joints), pipes, or water pipes (bongs).
 - A glance through research results on CBD from studies around the world shows evidence to support what we know already: CBD marijuana can help mental health conditions. These users are often careful in dosage, some even using just a few drops or “homeopathic” doses to get the desired effects.
 - Cannabis for Treating Mental Health Conditions? A Clear Yes, Maybe. Marijuana is now legal in two states, and legal for medical use in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Polls show the majority of Americans support cannabis legalization, and more and more of the country is joining the legalization trend.
 - There is growing evidence that people with serious mental illness, including depression and psychosis, are more likely to use cannabis or have used it for long periods of time in the past. Regular use of the drug has appeared to double the risk of developing a psychotic episode or long-term schizophrenia.
 - This leaflet looks at the research on the effects of cannabis use and mental health and is for anyone who is concerned about the issue. We hope that this will help people to make informed choices about using - or not using - cannabis. Cannabis is the most widely used substance in the UK.
 - Around the country, medical marijuana cards are routinely given to people suffering anxiety, depression, insomnia, ADHD, trauma, and mental health issues.
 - However, due to the possible exacerbation of psychotic mental illness that medical marijuana has the potential to cause, it should be used under the supervision of a physician who is aware of the patient’s current physical status and full medical (including mental health, family, and social) history.
 - Marijuana, or Cannabis, refers to the dried leaves, flowers, stems, and seeds from the hemp plant Cannabis sativa, which contains the psychoactive (mind-altering) chemical delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), as well as other related compounds.

========================================
LLM RESPONSE (The text being extracted from):
Heavy use of marijuana is associated with an increased risk of mental illness, including depression and psychosis. Regular use of the drug has appeared to double the risk of developing a psychotic episode or long-term schizophrenia. However, it is also noted that correlation does not imply causation, and some studies suggest that CBD marijuana can help mental health conditions. Therefore, while marijuana use is linked with mental illness, it does not necessarily cause it, and in some cases, it may even be used as a treatment.

CONTEXT:

 - But only the parts of Egypt closest to the Nile would have flooded with the black soil, and the Egyptians did not have any vocabulary to refer to race, so perhaps neither argument is wholly correct. 6 Cleopatra’s Mother
 - A coalition of groups and individuals—including the Arab American Institute Foundation—sent a letter to the Census Bureau last summer that asked for a separate “Middle East/North Africa” ethnic category. A question about Hispanic origin, currently the only ethnic category, has been asked of all households since 1980.
 - Egyptians (Egyptian Arabic: مَصريين‎‎ IPA:; Arabic: مِصريّون‎‎ Miṣriyyūn; Coptic: ϩⲁⲛⲣⲉⲙ̀ⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ Hanremenkīmi) are an ethnic group and the citizens native to Egypt sharing a common culture and a variety of Egyptian Arabic. Egyptian identity is closely tied to geography.
 - It depends but mostly African and middle eastern i believe they fall under possibly partly because many people in Egypt are mixed with middle eastern and African maybe and Egypt is in Africa. Arabic counts as well but from the list two or more races that or not hispanic.
 - Ancient Egypt was a northeast African civilization - a single group comprised of all manner of people. Ethnic groups is a contemporary term of no historical meaning. There is no contemporary classification of ethnic groups in Ancient Egypt.
 - The debate over the race of the Ancient Egyptians intensified during the movement to abolish slavery in the United States, as arguments relating to the justifications for slavery increasingly asserted the historical, mental and physical inferiority of black people.

QUESTION: do you have to pay to get papers notarized?
========================================
CONTEXT:
 - In our area most banks do it for free if you have an account with them. Also most real estate offices will have a notary that will do it for free hoping to get your business one day. I think the maximum notary fee here in AZ is $2.00 per notarized page if they want to charge you. Notary fees by state: Maximum Notary Fees By State: Don’t Get Ripped Off By Big Fat Notary Guys! | Punny Money.
 - Everyone Looped-In. If you wish, you can invite your collegues or manager to a job (great for when you are on vacation), or invite realtors and lenders, allowing them to view the details of a job, and even get email and text notifications when the status changes!
 - Public offices where you can find a notary public include the local clerk of court’s office and sometimes a public library. Law offices commonly have a notary on staff. If you need a power of attorney form notarized, you can generally have it done for free at the office of the attorney who prepared the document for you. Notarized documents are sometimes shipped overnight, so some UPS or FedEx stores have a notary public available.
 - Step 2: Scan over the document. To look for certificate wording that will tell you what type of notarization to perform. To review the certificate wording to make sure it contains all the elements a Notary certificate should have and that it conforms to the requirements of your state. To check for blank spaces.
 - There are few states that give new Notaries practical tips when performing their first notarization. Even states that have mandatory education requirements for commission applicants focus more on Notary law than Notary practice. To help the new Notaries in our community, here are 5 steps to a proper notarization:
 - Banks Can Notarize Your Documents for Free. If you need to get a document notarized, a simple, free solution can usually be found at the nearest branch of your bank. Getting a document notarized is typically very simple. Present the document to a notary public and sign it in her presence.
 - An apostille is a form of authentication issued to documents for use in countries that participate in the Hague Convention of 1961. If the country of intended use does not participate in the Hague Convention , documents being sent to that country can obtain a Certificate of Authentication.
 - Notaries charge a modest fee for this service. Fees charged often depend on where you get a document notarized. Many states set maximum allowable charges, and notaries can charge any amount up to that maximum (and they can also charge nothing at all). In many cases, notarial charges are between $2 and $20 per signature.
 - To obtain an apostille you must send the following information: Original notarized document to be authenticated or a certified copy to be authenticated that includes the original certification. Fee is $15.00 per document (a document can be more than one page).
 - Original notarized document to be authenticated or a certified copy to be authenticated that includes the original certification. 1  Fee is $15.00 per document (a document can be more than one page). 2  Make check or money order payable in U.S. dollars (USD) to: Secretary of State.

========================================
LLM RESPONSE (The text being extracted from):
Whether you have to pay to get papers notarized depends on where you get the documents notarized. Some banks and real estate offices offer this service for free, especially if you have an account with them or they hope to get your business in the future. However, some notaries do charge a fee, which can range from $2 to $20 per signature, depending on the state.

GROUND TRUTH (Claude):
 - ['getting papers notarized', 'has cost', 'depends on where you get the documents notarized']
 - ['Some banks', 'offer notarization service', 'for free']
 - ['Some real estate offices', 'offer notarization service', 'for free']
 - ['Banks offer free notarization', 'condition', 'especially if you have an account with them']
 - ['Some notaries', 'charge fee for notarization', 'true']
 - ['Fee for notarization by notaries', 'range', '$2 to $20 per signature']
 - ['Range of notarization fee', 'depends on', 'the state']

PREDICTED (GPT-OSS-120B):
 - ['Payment for notarization', 'depends on', 'location of notarization']
 - ['Banks', 'offer', 'free notarization service']
 - ['Real estate offices', 'offer', 'free notarization service']
 - ['Free notarization service', 'conditioned on', 'having an account with provider']
 - ['Free notarization service', 'conditioned on', 'provider hoping to get future business']
 - ['Notaries', 'charge', 'notarization fee']
 - ['Notarization fee', 'range', '$2 to $20 per signature']
 - ['Notarization fee', 'depends on', 'state']

👉 VERDICT: GPT-OSS IS MORE THOROUGH. Claude missed the second condition for free notarization ('hope to get your business'). GPT-OSS extracted both conditions.
